# Forest-Fire-Detection

Led the development of an AI-driven wildfire detection system combining satellite imagery, IoT environmental sensors, and drones for comprehensive real-time monitoring of remote forests.
Employed machine learning to analyze incoming data from satellites, drones, and ground sensors, detecting early wildfire indicators (smoke, heat) at their earliest stages.
Generated immediate alerts for firefighting teams, significantly reducing response times and preventing small fires from escalating into large-scale disasters.
Protected thousands of acres of forest and wildlife habitat, supporting conservation efforts and safeguarding local communities by enabling rapid intervention and minimizing wildfire damage.
